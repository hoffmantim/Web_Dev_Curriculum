# 1.2: Building a Personal Web Site

### What We Are Going to Build

For now, we'll be building our page in HTML only.

### Let's Start

1. Create a new folder called __Personal_Site__ and create a file called `index.html` inside.
2. Open your `index.html` file in VS Code.
3. Add the html stub by typing `html5` and hitting TAB when the correct helper text is highlighted (it should read `html5`).


### Section 1: The Header

1. Inside of the `<body>` tags, add an `<h1>` with your name.
  * note that when using an editor like VS Code, when you use the autocomplete to add a tag like an `<h1>`, it should automatically include the closing tag as well
2. Beneath that, add a few `<p>` tags with information about yourself, like current jobs or titles if you have any (I would put both Language Arts Teacher and Computer Science Teacher, for example).
3. Ad `<em>` tags to each of the above items to give them _empahsis_ (italics).
4. If you have a current employer, add an `<a>` tag with a link to their website (or you could add a link to the Hilbert School District website).
5. Use an `<hr>` tag to add a line (a __horizontal rule__) beneath this section.

### Section 2: Employment History

1. Add an `<h2>` that reads "Employment".
2. Beneath the heading, add a line for each of your employment positions, starting with the most recent. Use `<p>` tags for each line and put the years of employment in `<em>` tags. After each date, include the position you held and the name of your employer.
3. If you don't have a work history, include any volunteer or community work you've done.
4. Finish the section off with a horizontal line.

NOTE: We'll add some formatting and style to this section later to clean it up.

### Section 3: Skills

1. Add another `<h2>` that reads "Skills".
2. Use a `<p>` tag for each of the skills you want to list. This can be a one-word description (e.g. "Woodworking") or a short phrase.

We'll style this one up later, too, by making it a list.

### Other Stuff

Add another section or two with any other information you would like to include. This could be co-curricular activities, volunteer work you've done, organizations you belong to, etc.

Your web page should look something like the example at the top of this document.
