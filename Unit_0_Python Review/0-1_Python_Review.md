## 0.2: Python Review

Before we get into web development, we should review what you learned last year. While we'll be learning new languages, techniques, and procedures, much of what we'll be doing will be very similar to what we did last year. We'll be working with variables, lists, conditionals, loops, and functions to build all kinds of websites and web apps.

### Define the Following Terms
Write definitions or explanations for each of these terms:

* Int             
* Float
* String
* Boolean
* Variable
* Conditional
* Loop (2 kinds)
* Function
* Argument(s)
* Return
* Class

### Blackjack Project

Log into [replit.com](www.replit.com). If you don't remember your account info, you can try to use the "forgot password" button. Otherwise you'll need to create a new account.

Create a new project called __Blackjack__. Our first project is going to be a Python review. You're going to make a blackjack game.

### Game Requirements

* Build a shuffled deck of cards
* Deal two random cards to the player & two to the dealer
* Check for an automatic winner (21) or bust (over 21)
* Give the player options to _hit_ or _stay_
* Check again for a winner (highest hand over 21) or bust
* You'll need to use a list or dictionary, functions, and a game loop (minimum)
