# 3.4: JavaScript Drum Kit

Here's what we'll be making. The user will be able to "play" the drum kit by clicking on a button or by pressing the corresponding key on their keyboard.

Create a new folder called `Drum_Kit`. Create two sub-folders called `images` and `sound`.

Copy the following starter files into your folders:

[index.html](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-2cb8Eobylgz8qP72fQRzraRA3tWz_cR)
[styles.css](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JGldYmaCDlA6HHl3CO54hciN67Z8Mx_g)
[images folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z97BxqmbwrczEbPMuvBiMQjtqAga5CO8)
[sounds folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cHKND5raZZ_OUcCkXtYmY2cjY53xKi_X)

Last, add a scripts.js file to your project. If you open the index.html file in a browser, it should look like the image above.

We're going to use JavaScript to make the drum kit work.
